Using Deep Convolutional GANS to super sample images and increase their resolution <br/>

# Results
I compared [Nearest Neighbor](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.1.x/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.resize) Interpolation to my Deep Learned Super Sampling program <br/>
Here I am upsampling from ```128x128``` to ```256x256``` which is equivalent to increasing the size by ```4``` times
